= Introduction =

This page explains how to use the Tamanoir user interface to correct you picture scans.


= Details =

*Caution:* For the moment, only color slides are well supported for dust detection. See ToDo for future developments.

Tamanoir's GUI is divided in several sections:
  * *Load/save buttons* on top line
  * *Global picture display* on left
  * *Detailed views of dust and correction* on right
  * *Action buttons* to correct or skip correction
  * *Options:* film type, correction accelerations

Each button/view contains a tooltip which explains its function.

----

= Load / Save =

  * *Load:* Open a dialog to choose a file, then pre-process the picture with current options/settings, and goes to first detected dust

  * *Save:* save current image with the *same name than original*. A backup is stored with a _-copy_ extension by default for the moment. This backup may be an option only in the future versions.


= Global view / Main display =

The large image display shows the grayscaled version of input image, with inertion of small rectangles :
  * *Blue rectangle* where the dust has just been detected. This dust is displayed in blue in global view, and a crop of the neighbouring is shown in detail views (at scale 1:1).
  * *Green rectangles* where the proposed corrections have been accepted by the user ("Apply" button).
  * *Yellow rectangles* where the proposed corrections have been refused by the user ("Skip" button).
  * *Red rectangles* where the process could not find any fitting correction.

= Detail views =

There are 4 image displays for detailled view of currnt dust :
  * Top-left is a crop of *original image* around the detected dust. The proposed correction is represented by a green rectangle for the source of cloning, and the destination of the cloning is linked to source by a green line. *You can move the position of the source with the mouse*.
  * Bottom-left is the *corrected image*. If you move the source of the cloning on the original crop display, this display is refreshed immediatly.

  * Top-right is the binary image of detected dust. It's almost shown for debug purpose.
  * Bottom-right is the binary image of high frequency regions in original images. It's almost shown for debug purpose.

= Action buttons : Auto/Skip/Apply =

There are 3 kind of actions :
  * *Skip button:* make the process to go to next detected dust *without applying the correction* on original image. The user refuses the proposed correction.
  * *Apply button:* applies the proposed correction then goes to next dust.
  * *Auto button:* process all the image fast. It only correct trivial dust, like in _"Trust mode"_.

= Film settings : type and resolution =

Film options are :
  * *Film type:* the choices are : 
    * _Undefined_: the dusts are detected if they are lighter or darked than the background
    * _Positive_: for scans from positive images, slides or digital camera pictures. The dusts are only detected if they are darked than the background
    * _Negative_: for scans from negative film. The dusts are detected only if they are lighter than the background

Color or black&white pictures are detected automatically. If the picture present much grain, the image processing are tuned whithout informing the user.

  * Scan resolution : it modifies the size of the smallest detectable dust. The more dpi, the bigger the dust must be in images.

= Action options =

There are 2 options to accelerate the use of Tamanoir for the user : 
  * *Trust mode:* the corrections are automatically applied if the proposal is really good.
  * *Hot pixels detection:* it allows the software to detect 1-pixel light "dusts" in images. This should be used with "Auto" action or "Trust mode" to be acceptable for user.
