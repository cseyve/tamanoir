Roadmap & List of future evolutions

Dust detection algorithm : 
- Fix: I suppressed the checking for textured area because it prevented or correcting grainy B&W images
- Still a difference between the force mode (clone tool) and the nominal algorithm search : forcemode is better, but can't see why (less checking, but not easy to explain)...

Hot pixels removal: hidden in GUI because it does not support artefacts from JPEM compression
